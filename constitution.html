<h2 id="statement-of-purpose">Statement Of Purpose</h2>
<p>​
The purpose of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) [Special Interest Group on Building Educational Applications, SIGEDU] (the SIG) shall be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To promote interest in applying Natural Language Processing for Building Educational Applications to serve a wide breadth of learner and test taker populations. Topics include, but are not limited to, such aspects as:
    <ol>
      <li>Automated assessment of written or spoken test taker responses</li>
      <li>Spoken dialogue, Game-based assessment, Collaborative environments, and Intelligent Tutoring (IT) that incorporates NLP</li>
      <li>Development and Evaluation of tools for classroom teachers and/or test developers</li>
      <li>Innovative applications to support learning at scale, personalized learning and learning analytics</li>
      <li>Use of corpora in educational tools</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To provide members of the ACL who have a special interest in Educational Applications of NLP with a means of exchanging news of recent research developments</li>
  <li>To sponsor meetings and workshops (such as the BEA workshop) in the Edu-NLP domain, that appear to be timely and worthwhile</li>
  <li>To make it easier to coordinate/share organization efforts for joint meetings and workshops with related ACL SIGs</li>
  <li>To provide and make available relevant resources, including previous BEA workshop proceedings, bibliographies, test suites, tools, applications, research papers and publicly available libraries and generated resources</li>
</ul>

<p>SIGEDU will operate within the framework of the ACL’s general guidelines for SIGs.</p>

<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>​
The SIG will organize the annual BEA workshop, which is one of the longest running workshops in ACL. The work provides a forum for the presentation of peer-reviewed research in all aspects of NLP research related to building educational applications. The workshop will be collocated with the annual meeting of the ACL, or at one of its chapters, as before. If this is not feasible, the SIG may decide to collocate the workshop with some other conference. An annual business meeting of the SIG shall also take place at the workshop venue.</p>

<h2 id="membership">Membership</h2>

<p><strong>Joining</strong>: Membership is open to anyone who professes an interest in applying NLP for building educational applications. It does not require ACL membership. The membership can be obtained either through provided electronic means or by filling a membership form in conjunction with a SIG meeting.</p>

<p><strong>Termination</strong>: Membership will be terminated on request, or automatically if no reply is received within 2 months of a timely membership renewal request. Termination requests are to be communicated by email to the Secretary. Automatically terminated memberships will be reinstated on request.</p>

<h2 id="dues">Dues</h2>

<h2 id="changes-to-the-constitution">Changes To The Constitution</h2>
<p>​
Amendments to the constitution of the SIG may be proposed by any SIG member. These must be communicated to the Secretary who shall in turn announce them to the SIG members for discussion at the SIG mailing list. Suggested amendments must obtain the initial support of at least three SIG members and should be proposed at least a month prior to their consideration at the annual SIG business meeting. The minutes of the discussion related to the proposed amendments shall be publicized at the SIG website and the respective amendments shall be ratified by a two thirds majority vote by all SIG members. The vote shall take place electronically (either by e-mail, or via a dedicated web service) within a month, at the latest, after the SIG business meeting. Once ratified, the amendments shall be of immediate effect. The ACL Executive Committee may veto proposed constitution changes if they are incompatible with the ACL Constitution or SIG guidelines.
