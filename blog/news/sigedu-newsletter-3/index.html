<ul>
  <li><strong>The 14th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications (BEA14)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Location</strong>: Florence, Italy; August 2, 2019 (co-located with ACL)</li>
  <li><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://sig-edu.org/bea/2019">https://sig-edu.org/bea/2019</a></li>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<p>The BEA Workshop is a leading venue for NLP innovation in the context of educational applications. It is one of the largest one-day workshops in the ACL community with over 80 attendees in the past several years. The growing interest in educational applications and a diverse community of researchers involved resulted in the creation of the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=2018Q3_Reports:_SIGEDU">Special Interest Group in Educational Applications (SIGEDU)</a> in 2017 which currently has 159 members.</p>

<p>The workshop’s continuing growth highlights the alignment between societal needs and technological advances. NLP capabilities can now support an array of learning domains, including writing, speaking, reading, science, and mathematics, as well as the related intra-personal (e.g., self-confidence) and inter-personal (e.g., peer collaboration) skills. Within these areas, the community continues to develop and deploy innovative NLP approaches for use in educational settings. In the writing and speech domains, automated writing evaluation (AWE) and speech scoring applications, respectively, are commercially deployed in high-stakes assessment and in instructional contexts (e.g., Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and K-12 classrooms). Commercially-deployed plagiarism detection is also commonly used in both K-12 and higher education settings. For writing, the focus is on innovations that support writing tasks requiring source use, argumentative discourse, and factual content accuracy. For speech, there is an interest in advancing automated scoring to include the evaluation of discourse and content features in responses to spoken assessments. General advances in speech technology have promoted a renewed interest in spoken dialog and multimodal systems for instruction and assessment, for instance, for workplace interviews and simulated teaching environments. The explosive growth of mobile applications for game-based and simulation-based applications is another area where NLP has begun to play a large role, especially for language learning.</p>

<p>NLP for educational applications has gained visibility outside of the NLP community. First, the Hewlett Foundation reached out to the public and private sectors and sponsored two competitions: one for automated essay scoring, and the other for scoring of short response items. The motivation driving these competitions was to engage the larger scientific community in this enterprise. Learning @ Scale is a relatively new venue for NLP research in education. MOOCs now incorporate AWE systems to manage several thousand assignments that may be received during a single MOOC course. MOOCs for Refugees have more recently emerged in response to the current social situations. Courses include language learning, and we can imagine that AWE and other NLP capabilities could support coursework. Another breakthrough for educational applications within the CL community is the presence of a number of shared-task competitions over the past several years – including three shared tasks on grammatical error detection and correction. NLP/Education shared tasks have seen new areas of research, such as the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing at BEA 11, Native Language Identification at BEA 12, Second Language Acquisition Modelling at BEA 13, and Complex Word Identification at BEA 13.  These competitions increased the visibility of, and interest in, our field.</p>

<p>The 14th BEA workshop will have oral presentation sessions and a large poster session in order to maximize the amount of original work presented. We expect that the workshop will continue to highlight novel technologies and opportunities for educational NLP in English as well as other languages. The workshop will solicit both full papers and short papers for either oral or poster presentation. We will solicit papers that incorporate NLP methods, including, but not limited to: automated scoring of open-ended textual and spoken responses; game-based instruction and assessment; educational data mining; intelligent tutoring; peer review; grammatical error detection and correction; learner cognition; spoken dialog; multimodal applications; tools for teachers and test developers; and use of corpora.

<h3 id="shared-task-grammatical-error-correction">Shared Task: Grammatical Error Correction</h3>
<p> 
The BEA14 workshop is also hosting a shared task on Grammatical Error Correction.</p>

<p>More information can be found on the task webpage: <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/</a></p>

<h3 id="submission-information">Submission Information</h3>
<p> 
We will be using the ACL Submission Guidelines for the BEA14 Workshop this year. Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions.</p>

<p>Papers which describe systems are also invited to give a demo of their system. If you would like to present a demo in addition to presenting the paper, please make sure to select either “full paper + demo” or “short paper + demo” under “Submission Category” in the START submission page.</p>

<p>Previously published papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”.</p>

<p>We have also included conflict of interest in the submission form. You should mark all potential reviewers who have been authors on the paper, are from the same research group or institution, or who have seen versions of this paper or discussed it with you.</p>

<p>We will be using the START conference system to manage submissions:

<h2 id="gec-shared-task-2019-results">GEC Shared Task 2019 Results</h2>

<p>We are pleased to report that the recently completed BEA 19 Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) was a huge success and received a total of 37 submissions across all 3 tracks. Of these, 21 submissions were also made to the main Restricted Track, which is the largest number of submissions to a single GEC shared task to date. A further 9 teams also submitted to the Low Resource track, which aimed to encourage research into low-resource GEC where large quantities of annotated data may not be available. More information and shared task results can be found on the following page: <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/</a></p>

<p>Participants are currently writing papers about their submissions, and these will all be published and presented at the next BEA workshop in Florence. Many thanks to Christopher Bryant, Mariano Felice, Øistein Andersen and Ted Briscoe for organising the shared task, and we also look forward to a Shared Task overview paper in August!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Location</strong>: Graz, Austria</li>
  <li><strong>Official Website</strong>: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/slate2019">https://sites.google.com/view/slate2019</a></li>
  <li><strong>Dates</strong>: September 20 - 21, 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>The 8th ISCA Workshop on Speech and Language Technology in Education (SLaTE 2019) will be held in conjunction with Interspeech 2019 in Graz, Austria, on September 20 - 21, 2019.  
The workshop will welcome papers covering all topics related to speech and language technology in education. 
This includes, but is not limited to, the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>speech technology for first and second language learning</li>
  <li>natural language processing for education</li>
  <li>spoken dialog systems for education</li>
  <li>applications using speech and/or natural language processing for education</li>
  <li>intelligent tutoring systems using speech and natural language</li>
  <li>robot-assisted learning</li>
  <li>development of language resources for SLaTE applications</li>
  <li>assessment and user studies of SLaTE methods and applications</li>
  <li>theoretical and methodological issues in SLaTE</li>
  <li>use of speech synthesis for language learning</li>
  <li>serious games in SLaTE</li>
  <li>SLaTE for communicative disorders and pathology</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, following the first edition of the Spoken CALL Shared Task at SLaTE 2017 and the second edition at Interspeech 2018, we invite submissions to the third edition as a special session at SLaTE 2019. 
This shared task will use the same training data and resources as the second edition, but the results will be evaluated on new test data. 
Given the strong results reported in the second edition, we are however making an important change: the third edition will use a new and more challenging scoring metric. 
Full details are available from the Shared Task 3 site.</p>

<p><strong>Workshop description</strong></p>

<p>The workshop series on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (NLP4CALL) is a meeting place for researchers working on the integration of Natural Language Processing and Speech Technologies in CALL systems and exploring the theoretical and methodological issues arising in this connection. 
The latter includes, among others, insights from Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research, on the one hand, and promote development of “Computational SLA” through setting up Second Language research infrastructure(s), on the other.</p>

<p>The intersection of Natural Language Processing (or Language Technology / Computational Linguistics) and Speech Technology with Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) brings “understanding” of language to CALL tools, thus making CALL intelligent. 
This fact has given the name for this area of research – Intelligent CALL, ICALL. 
As the definition suggests, apart from having excellent knowledge of Natural Language Processing and/or Speech Technology, ICALL researchers need good insights into second language acquisition theories and practices, as well as knowledge of second language pedagogy and didactics. 
This workshop invites therefore a wide range of ICALL-relevant research, including studies where NLP-enriched tools are used for testing SLA and pedagogical theories, and vice versa, where SLA theories, pedagogical practices or empirical data are modeled in ICALL tools.</p>

<p>The NLP4CALL workshop series is aimed at bringing together competences from these areas for sharing experiences and brainstorming around the future of the field.</p>

<p>We welcome papers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that describe research directly aimed at ICALL;</li>
  <li>that demonstrate actual or discuss the potential use of existing Language and Speech Technologies or resources for language learning;</li>
  <li>that describe the ongoing development of resources and tools with potential usage in ICALL, either directly in interactive applications, or indirectly in materials, application or curriculum development, e.g.   learning   material   generation, assessment of learner texts and responses, individualized learning solutions, provision of feedback;</li>
  <li>that discuss challenges and/or research agenda for ICALL</li>
  <li>that describe empirical studies on language learner data.</li>
</ul>

<p>A special focus is given to the established and upcoming infrastructures aimed at SLA and learner corpus research, covering questions such as data collection, legal issues, reliability of annotation, annotation tool development, search environments for SLA-relevant data, etc.
We encourage paper presentations and software demonstrations describing the above-mentioned themes primarily, but not exclusively, for the Nordic languages.</p>

<p><strong>Invited speakers</strong></p>

<p>This year we have the pleasure to welcome two invited speakers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
